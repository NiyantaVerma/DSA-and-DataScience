# You're attempting to climb a hillâ€”not in a mathematical optimization sense (check out hill climbing for that), but literally outside, touching grass, and trying to climb a hill.

# Imagine there are n steps carved into the hill. You can go up using either 1 or 2 steps at a time.

# Your task is to return the number of distinct ways to reach the top of the hill.

# Example 1:
# Input: 3
# Output: 3
# Explanation: There are three distinct ways to climb to the top of a hill with 3 steps:

# Take 1 step, then 1 step, then 1 step.
# Take 1 step, then 2 steps.
# Take 2 steps, then 1 step.
